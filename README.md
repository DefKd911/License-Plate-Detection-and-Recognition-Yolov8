2. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Higher accuracy with lower computational cost
   - Faster training convergence
   - Better small object detection (perfect for license plates)
   - Improved robustness in various lighting conditions

3. **Model Variants**:
   - **YOLOv8n** (Nano): Ultra-fast, lightweight
   - **YOLOv8s** (Small): Balanced speed and accuracy
   - **YOLOv8m** (Medium): Higher accuracy
   - **YOLOv8l** (Large): Maximum accuracy
   - **YOLOv8x** (Extra Large): Best performance
